New Idea:
	No more RTS stuff for audience.  Instead, Final Fantasy Battle.
	Sharpen the two modes much more signficantly.
	Player choice should be much more muted during the action portion of the game.
	No mess of icons on the screen for audience players - just name + health.
	Audience Player actions should happen one at a time during their phase.
	New goal - only the audience can kill the opposing streamer.
	Really see them one at a time do their thing.
	Make it much more interpersonal - audience actions should always have targets.
	Make it so that the audience action phase is of variable length, depending on how many active players there are.
	Balloons behind trees
	Balloons massive slowdown.
	Make floor more visibile in front of lights
	Make spawned stuff align better with the timer
	More rounds + more backgrounds + more musics
